Requirements
===================

You probably need Chicken scheme for it to work... chance are that the `load` and `require-extensions` might be slightly different with other scheme interpreters. I guess that fixing the imports should be enough to make it work on any `rs5r` compliant scheme.

Compile with Chicken
====================

The `main.csc` contains both graphs and call each method with the same graph. It could be usefull to compare the final size of the paths generated by both algorithms for the same graphs.

    csc main.scm
    ./main
